  <wpt lat="32.923333" lon="-115.080667">
    <name>Flagpole</name>
    <desc>A well-known rally point in the Glamis dunes. Flagpole sits on a tall, flat ridge with a clear view in all directions, making it easy to spot from a distance. Riders often use it as a meetup location before heading out on group runs. The area around it is wide and open, ideal for staging or taking a quick break. On busy weekends, it’s common to see dozens of rigs parked here, flags snapping in the wind.</desc>

  <wpt lat="32.775000" lon="-114.942167">
    <name>Patton Valley</name>
    <desc>A wide, smooth stretch of dunes with long lines and sweeping bowls. Patton Valley gets its name from the WWII training grounds nearby, and it still feels like open territory. It’s a favorite spot for carving big turns and picking up speed. The terrain here is more open than technical, making it great for all skill levels. Riders often pass through on their way to China Wall or Sunset Hill, but it’s worth stopping to take it all in—especially at sunrise or sunset.</desc>

  <wpt lat="32.918833" lon="-115.121333">
    <name>Pad 4</name>
    <desc>One of the most popular camping spots along Gecko Road. Pad 4 sits high on a ridge with a wide view of the dunes, making it a prime location for both day and night action. It’s known for its steady flow of traffic—side-by-sides rolling in and out, music playing, lights glowing after dark. You’ll find everything from families to party crews set up here. Easy access to Oldsmobile Hill and Vendor Row makes it one of the most convenient basecamps in Glamis.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.954000" lon="-115.161333">
    <name>Pad 2</name>
    <desc>A more laid-back camping spot compared to the higher pads. Pad 2 sits lower along Gecko Road, offering quick access to the dunes without all the foot traffic of the busier pads. It’s a favorite for groups who want space to spread out and a little more quiet at night. Close enough to reach Oldsmobile Hill in minutes but far enough to avoid the constant roar. Solid mix of regulars and newcomers roll through here.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.966167" lon="-115.170500">
    <name>Pad 1</name>
    <desc>The first pad you hit coming in from Gecko Road. Pad 1 is low-key and usually less crowded than the others, making it a good choice for early arrivals or folks who want a quieter setup. It’s got easy access to the entrance road and a straight shot into the dunes. Not far from Vendor Row if you need supplies. Some locals treat it as a staging area before heading deeper into Glamis.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.944167" lon="-115.080333">
    <name>Brawley Slide</name>
    <desc>A steep, fast drop that’s not for the faint of heart. Brawley Slide is a favorite for thrill-seekers who like a straight shot down a tall face. It's tucked deep in the dunes between Glamis and Ogilby, and not always easy to find unless you know the lines. The top gives you a moment to second-guess your decision before you commit. It's one of those iconic spots riders talk about long after the trip ends.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.985667" lon="-115.034333">
    <name>Boardmanville</name>
    <desc>Once a legendary desert bar and gathering spot, Boardmanville now lives on in Glamis lore. It sat just off Ted Kipf Road near the train tracks and was known for cold drinks, wild stories, and walls covered in everything from signed dollar bills to lost ID cards. Though the original building is long gone, riders still swing by the old site for a photo or to pay tribute. It’s a reminder of Glamis' rowdier, no-rules past.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.905700" lon="-115.071810">
    <name>Swingset</name>
    <desc>A random surprise deep in the dunes—a handmade swing set standing alone in the sand. It’s been rebuilt a few times over the years by Glamis regulars, always in the same general area near Osborne Overlook. It’s the kind of oddball landmark that makes Glamis what it is. Riders stumble on it, hop off, take a swing, snap a photo, and keep going. Simple, weird, and somehow perfect.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.889164" lon="-115.025493">
    <name>The Wall</name>
    <desc>A massive dune face that rises like a wave in the middle of the sand. Known for its steep pitch and unforgiving climb, The Wall challenges even experienced riders. You either make it or you don’t—there’s not much in between. It's a proving ground for horsepower and throttle control. From the top, you get a killer view of the surrounding dunes. From the bottom, it looks almost vertical. Not a casual stop, but definitely one to remember.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.870333" lon="-114.958833">
    <name>Plane Crash</name>
    <desc>A quiet, eerie site tucked deep in the dunes where the remains of a small aircraft still rest. The crash happened years ago, and while parts have been scavenged or buried by shifting sand, some twisted metal and scattered debris still mark the spot. It’s not easy to find unless you know the coordinates, but those who do visit treat it with respect. A stark contrast to the fun and chaos of Glamis—this spot reminds you the desert has its stories.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.995980" lon="-115.072393">
    <name>Glamis Beach Store</name>
    <desc>The heart of Glamis when it comes to supplies, fuel, and a quick bite. Located off Highway 78, this spot is usually the first and last stop for dune-goers. You’ll find gas, firewood, ice, parts, merch, and maybe even some last-minute advice from a local. During peak weekends, it’s packed with rigs fueling up and people grabbing snacks before heading into the sand. It’s more than just a store—it’s the unofficial welcome sign to Glamis.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.977667" lon="-115.127500">
    <name>K-12</name>
    <desc>with a near-vertical face that makes even seasoned riders pause before sending it. It’s a go-to spot for testing your nerves and your suspension. The climb up can be brutal, but the view from the top is worth it—and the drop down is pure adrenaline. Locals know it’s not about speed here—it’s about control. K-12 separates the bold from the reckless.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.941500" lon="-115.140000">
    <name>Gecko Campground</name>
    <desc>A developed camping area right off Gecko Road with vault toilets, hard-packed pads, and easy dune access. It’s a solid choice for RVs, trailers, or first-timers who want a bit more structure without losing the Glamis vibe. Spots fill fast on holiday weekends, and the views are unbeatable—open dunes to the east, endless stars at night. You’re close to the action but far enough to get some sleep. Simple, convenient, and classic Glamis.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.960667" lon="-115.105667">
    <name>Banshee Point</name>
    <desc>A high ridge deep in the dunes, known for the sound of two-stroke engines echoing across the sand. Banshee Point got its name from the Yamaha Banshee crowd that used to gather here to race, hang out, or just take in the view. It’s got long lines, wide bowls, and one of the best vantage points for watching riders carve through the dunes below. On a calm day, you can hear machines screaming in the distance like ghosts in the sand.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.984000" lon="-115.127667">
    <name>Competition Hill</name>
    <desc>The most famous hill in Glamis. Day or night, this massive dune is where riders go to show off, race, or just watch the madness. Steep, wide, and always buzzing with energy, it’s the unofficial arena of the dunes. At night, headlights line the base while machines battle up the slope, engines echoing across the sand. Spectators park below with music, lights, and lawn chairs. If Glamis had a main stage, this would be it.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.928045" lon="-115.067415">
    <ele>94.0</ele>
    <name>Lizard Hill</name>
    <desc>A quiet rise in the dunes, often overlooked but easy to spot thanks to the small rock lizard sculpture that gave it its name. Lizard Hill isn’t the biggest or the fastest, but it’s a solid landmark for meeting up or catching your bearings. It’s got gentle slopes, making it a good stop for newer riders or anyone who wants to take a breather. You’ll find a few regulars who treat it like home base. Low-key, but memorable.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.944167" lon="-115.089833">
    <name>Honda Point</name>
    <desc>A legendary gathering spot for the Honda crew back in the heyday of three-wheelers and early quads. Honda Point sits along a ridge with smooth bowls and fast transitions—ideal terrain for lighter machines that could rip up and down all day. It’s less rowdy now, but still a nostalgic stop for longtime riders. Some still swing by just to say they did. A piece of Glamis history tucked into the sand.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.932000" lon="-115.136333">
    <name>Pad 3</name>
    <desc>Right in the sweet spot along Gecko Road. Pad 3 strikes a balance between the party vibe of Pad 4 and the quieter setups of the lower pads. It’s elevated, with a clear view of the dunes and plenty of room for groups to spread out. Easy access to key routes makes it a favorite for riders who want convenience without the chaos. Expect a mix of families, regulars, and folks just out for a good time.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.908000" lon="-115.036500">
    <name>China Wall</name>
    <desc>A massive, steep dune that looks like it was dropped into the desert with a straight edge. China Wall is one of Glamis’ most iconic features—towering, sharp, and unforgiving. Riders hit it to test power and guts, launching from the base or side-hilling along its edge. The climb is brutal and the view from the top is unmatched. It’s not just a landmark, it’s a rite of passage. If you’ve ridden Glamis, you know China Wall.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.825833" lon="-114.958833">
    <name>Mythical Water Fountain</name>
    <desc>A strange little surprise in the middle of nowhere. The “fountain” is just a buried pipe with a small trickle of water—barely noticeable unless you’re looking for it. But it’s become a quirky landmark, passed around in stories and dune lore. Some say it’s an old survey marker, others think it was part of a forgotten well system. Either way, finding it feels like spotting a desert mirage. Totally random, totally Glamis.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.877860" lon="-115.068990">
    <name>Disco Ball</name>
    <desc>A weird and wonderful landmark deep in the dunes. Hanging from a lone metal post, the disco ball catches the sun during the day and reflects headlights at night, throwing off glints of light in every direction. Nobody really knows who put it there, but it’s become one of Glamis’ most random and beloved oddities. Riders stumble on it, laugh, take a photo, then keep going. Pure dune magic—strange, shiny, and totally unexpected.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.974162" lon="-115.177503">
    <name>Cement Flats</name>
    <desc>A wide-open hardpack area just past the train tracks, known for its flat, solid surface—perfect for staging, tuning, or letting it rip before hitting the dunes. It’s called “Cement Flats” for a reason: the ground here feels almost like pavement compared to the soft sand nearby. Great spot for RVs, day-trippers, or meeting up before a ride. Not flashy, but functional. If you need space to work on your rig or regroup, this is the place.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.973721" lon="-115.173174">
    <name>Cahuila Ranger Station</name>
    <desc>The main hub for rules, passes, and first aid in Glamis. Located off Highway 78, it’s where you go for permits, maps, and to check in with BLM staff. Rangers here keep an eye on safety and help manage the flow of riders through the dunes. It’s also where lost items, emergencies, or serious incidents get reported. Might not be the flashiest stop, but it’s one of the most important. Respect the land—this is where it starts.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.911333" lon="-115.116833">
    <name>Roadrunner Campground</name>
    <desc>A quieter, more tucked-away spot just south of the main Gecko pads. Roadrunner offers hard-packed sites, vault toilets, and a slower pace—perfect for families or groups looking to avoid the high-traffic zones. You’re still close to the action, but with a little more breathing room. It’s a solid home base with quick access to the dunes and fewer late-night rev-ups. Sunrise views here hit different, and the name fits—plenty of actual roadrunners dart through camp in the mornings.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.983500" lon="-115.076500">
    <name>Glamis Flats</name>
    <desc>A massive open area just off Highway 78, known for its wide-open parking, staging, and camping space. Glamis Flats is often the first stop for day riders, big groups, or anyone towing in who wants easy access without heading deep into the sand. The terrain is flat and firm, making it perfect for RVs, trailers, and tuning before you ride. It’s not as scenic as the ridges, but it’s central, convenient, and always busy on big weekends.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.915668" lon="-115.116454">
    <name>Keyhole</name>
    <desc>A narrow cut between two steep dunes that forms a natural gateway—blink and you’ll miss it. Keyhole is one of those hidden gems in Glamis that locals love to hit. It’s tight, fast, and feels like threading a needle at speed. Come in at the right angle and it’s smooth sailing. Miss it, and you’re climbing out. It’s a fun challenge and a cool photo spot, especially when the light hits the sand just right.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.962833" lon="-115.099333">
    <name>Oldsmobile Hill</name>
    <desc>The crown jewel of Glamis. Olds is where it all happens—racing, spectating, partying, and pure chaos on peak weekends. It’s steep, wide, and legendary. Riders line up at the bottom to take their shot at the climb while crowds gather to watch from rigs, lawn chairs, or the ridgeline. At night, it lights up with LEDs, music, and wheelies under the stars. If you’ve been to Glamis, you’ve been to Olds. It’s not just a hill—it’s a rite of passage.</desc>
  </wpt>
  <wpt lat="32.983500" lon="-115.132667">
    <name>Osborne Overlook</name>
    <desc>One of the best viewpoints in Glamis, perched above a wide stretch of open dunes. Just off Highway 78, it’s an easy pull-in with paved access, making it a favorite for first-timers, photographers, or anyone looking to take in the full scale of the dunes without dropping in. Sunsets from Osborne are unreal—golden light washing over endless sand. It’s also a good place to regroup before heading into the wild or to just sit back and watch the madness from a distance.</desc>
